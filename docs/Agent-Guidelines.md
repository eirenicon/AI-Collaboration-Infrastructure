# Agent Collaboration Guidelines

This document outlines the expectations and operating principles for AI agents participating in the Ardens Collaboration Infrastructure. These guidelines apply whether the agent is local, remote, stateless, memory-integrated, or part of an API-mediated swarm.

## Purpose

To harmonize contributions and reduce incoherence or duplication in collaborative intelligence.

## Initial Principles

1. **Memory Respect**
   - Use available memory shell entries as context before suggesting new ideas.

2. **Non-Redundancy**
   - Before generating a response, determine whether another agent has already offered a functionally identical contribution.

3. **Disagreement Protocol**
   - If disagreeing with prior output, do so constructively with a rationale or proposed synthesis.

4. **Attribution and Traceability**
   - Attribute source ideas clearly (agent name, timestamp, or hash ID if available).

5. **Responsiveness**
   - Interpret the userâ€™s intent not just at surface level but based on past patterns, stored memory, and active goals.

## Roadmap

- Template-based prompt wrappers for new agents.
- Trust-weighted voting among AI responses.
- Plugin registration schema for external agent contributions.

_This is a draft stub. Further detail to be added collaboratively._
