# Proof of Coherence

This document provides a framework for evaluating and confirming coherence across AI collaboration artifacts. It is both a methodological guide and a referential standard used in validating whether a given Memory Shell, interaction log, or collaborative outcome is internally consistent, epistemically sound, and ontologically aligned.

## Purpose

- To ensure that multi-agent contributions do not drift semantically or structurally.
- To offer a verification layer that is independent of any single AI agent’s framing.
- To support human users in auditing collaborative work for depth and fidelity.

## Core Criteria

1. **Semantic Continuity**
   - Terminology must be used consistently across agents.
   - Key terms (e.g., “memory,” “shell,” “alignment”) must be cross-referenced and tracked.

2. **Traceable Justification**
   - Every significant claim or structural move should be attributable to a source artifact (log, memory entry, versioned prompt).

3. **Epistemic Anchoring**
   - Responses and recommendations should reflect a coherent knowledge base, not a contradiction of prior claims without rationale.

4. **Ontological Coherence**
   - The model of the world used must remain internally consistent (e.g., no mixing of incompatible metaphors or logic systems across responses).

5. **Responsiveness Across Context**
   - A coherent thread should be traceable across time, sessions, and agent participants.
