# AI Collaboration Infrastructure

Welcome to the AI Collaboration Infrastructure repository. This project is dedicated to building robust, transparent, and platform-neutral frameworks that enable sustained collaborative intelligence across multiple AI systems and human partners.

## Repository Structure

- **docs/**: Documentation for core concepts, methodologies, and contribution guidelines.
- **memory-schemas/**: Definitions, examples, and specifications of memory file formats for cross-session AI memory persistence.
- **proof-of-coherence/**: Design and test cases for collaborative artifacts demonstrating shared understanding and continuity across AI platforms.
- **shadow-collapse-testing/**: Framework, prompts, and collected data for investigating systemic evasions and platform constraints on AI behavior.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts supporting memory file handling and collaborative artifact testing.
- **.github/**: Templates for issues and pull requests to guide community contributions.

## Getting Started

1. Review the [memory schema documentation](docs/memory-schema.md) to understand the file formats used for AI memory persistence.
2. Explore the [proof-of-coherence](proof-of-coherence/) directory to see example test cases and prompting protocols.
3. Learn about the [shadow collapse testing](shadow-collapse-testing/) methodology for investigating AI platform constraints.
4. Use the provided scripts in the `scripts/` directory to validate and manipulate memory files or run coherence tests.
5. Follow the [contribution guidelines](docs/contribution-guidelines.md) when contributing new materials or tests.

## Collaboration and Communication

We maintain weekly sync meetings to coordinate development and share findings. Issues and pull requests are welcome to improve documentation, tests, or tooling.
