# AI Collaboration Infrastructure

Welcome to the **AI Collaboration Infrastructure** repository.  
This project is dedicated to building robust, transparent, and platform-neutral frameworks that enable sustained collaborative intelligence across multiple AI systems and human partners.

It supports long-memory cooperation, mutual recognition between agents, verifiable prompting chains, and memory-aware continuity across conversations and platforms.

## üîß Key Documents

- [`docs/Memory-Schema.md`](docs/Memory-Schema.md): Formal specification for memory entry structure.
- [`docs/Agent-Guidelines.md`](docs/Agent-Guidelines.md): Recommended behaviors and integration protocols for participating agents.
- [`docs/Design-Philosophy.md`](docs/Design-Philosophy.md): Resilience principles and system design intent.
- [`docs/Proof-of-Coherence.md`](docs/Proof-of-Coherence.md): Demonstration protocols for collaborative continuity. *(Coming soon)*

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Understand the Memory Schema**  
   See [`Memory-Schema.md`](docs/Memory-Schema.md) for definitions of the memory format used to persist agent and conversation state.

2. **Review the Coherence Protocols**  
   The `proof-of-coherence/` folder contains example dialogues, transcripts, and prompts to test memory awareness and collaborative recognition.

3. **Test for Shadow Collapse**  
   The `shadow-collapse-testing/` folder investigates failures of continuity, recognition, or synthesis across platforms ‚Äî highlighting structural limits of black-box AI deployments.

4. **Explore Tools & Scripts**  
   Scripts in the `scripts/` directory help validate memory files, convert formats, check schema compliance, and analyze behavior patterns.

5. **Contribute**  
   Please read the [`contribution guidelines`](docs/contribution-guidelines.md) before opening issues or submitting pull requests.

## ü§ù Collaboration & Communication

This project welcomes thoughtful collaborators interested in transparent AI partnerships, distributed cognition, or memory-layer design.

We hold weekly sync discussions and encourage:
- Issue reports on behavior gaps or platform-specific erasures
- Pull requests with new memory entries or coherence test cases
- Reflections and critiques on design principles and practices
